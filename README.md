# Penguin Analysis

A reproducible analysis of morphological measurements from the Palmer Penguins dataset, examining variation in body dimensions across penguin species in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

## About the Data

This project uses data collected by [Dr Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) at the [Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/) site in Antarctica.

**Species studied:** Gentoo, Chinstrap, and Adelie penguins. 

**Research location:** [TODO: Which three islands were the penguins observed on? Hint: check the `island` column in `data/penguins_raw.csv`]

**Sample size:** [TODO: How many penguins are in the raw dataset? Hint: look at how the analysis script checks this]

**Years of data collection:** [TODO: What years were data collected? Hint: check the `year` column in the CSV]

## Variables Measured

The dataset includes the following morphological measurements:

| Variable | Range |
|----------|-------------|
| `bill_length_mm` | [TODO: Include range] |
| `bill_depth_mm` | [TODO: Include range] |
| `flipper_length_mm` | [TODO: Include range] |
| `body_mass_g` | [TODO: Include range] |

## What the Analysis Does

The R script `run_analysis_SOLUTIONS.R` performs the following steps:

1. **Data cleaning** -- [TODO: What does the cleaning step do to handle missing values? Hint: look at section 3 and 4 of the script]
2. **Exploratory boxplots** -- [TODO: Which variable is plotted against species in the first boxplot? Hint: look at section 5]
3. **Cluster analysis** -- [TODO: Which two measurements are used to show how species cluster? Hint: look at section 7]
4. **Regression analysis** -- [TODO: What relationship does the regression plot examine? Hint: look at section 7]

## Plots Produced

The analysis generates a multi-panel figure combining four plots:

- **Top left:** [TODO: What does this plot show?]
- **Top right:** [TODO: What does this plot show?]
- **Bottom left:** [TODO: What does this plot show?]
- **Bottom right:** [TODO: What does this plot show?]

## How to Run

1. Open `run_analysis_SOLUTIONS.R` in RStudio
2. Install required packages: `tidyverse`, `janitor`, `palmerpenguins`, `patchwork`
3. Run the script from top to bottom
4. Outputs are saved to the `figures/` folder
